<p style="text-align: center"><b>Hey I'm Sidd, welcome to my website</b></p>
<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<h3>Professionally</h3>
<!-- <a class="link" href="#WhoAmIReally">click here for something jucier</a> -->

I began my bachelors degree back in 2017 and it's been quite the rollercoaster. However, 7 years later I’m in my last semester of computer engineering at UBC.

3 of those years were spent outside of UBC doing the following:
- I spent **8 months** working at Magnitude Software where I got my first taste of writing production level code and where I learned what it means to work in a professional setting.
- I was a sergeant in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) for **2 years**. There I developed a strong sense of ownership for my work and a sense of responsibility for those under me. I also leveraged my education up to that point to solve problems.
- Lastly, I spent **4 months** in a seed stage fintech startup. There I worked on many facets of the product, gaining experience

I’m at my best when I’m working with other people and am driven by solving problems to do good. I chose software as my tool due to its power and versatility, and most recently I've been drawn to cybersecurity and ML. With technologies like deep learning showing they have the potential to solve almost any problem it means there are plenty of people who want to exploit it. 

_I want to solve big problems while ensuring the safety and privacy of those most vulnerable to attacks._

<h3 id="WhoAmIReally">Really</h3>

There are a few things I truly value and hold dear to my heart. 
1. Family, friends, and health
2. Being genuine
3. Routine
4. A freshly baked loaf of bread

I’ve lived in 5 countries, moved 7 times, met a lot of great people, picked up some hobbies, learnt a lot about myself, and I'm excited to see what else I have in store. They were all special for different reasons. Dubai is where I was born and is where my parents live, it's the only place I get to see my awesome dogs. Singapore has some amazing food and it's where I really learned to cook with my brother (I guess I also served in the army for a while). Bangladesh was a turning point for me, being around people who looked like me and spoke my language helped me become a more confident person. Bahrain showed me that the world is a big place and some of the best people are in the smallest countries. Vancouver is one of the most gorgeous places I've ever seen and has given me some of my best friends.
Moving around this much meant that home isn't a place. It's been tiring but I feel lucky to have grown up the way I bave.

I could talk a lot more about how I used to play so many sports and now just weightlift. I could talk about how my brother is my best friend and our relationship has changed over the years. I could talk about how I think I'm one of the funniest people I know. I could write a whole book year about who I really am but I think that should be saved for another time, don't you think?
