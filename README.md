This website has been adapted from a jekyll theme and is a way for me to display projects I've worked on.

To run locally do the following:

1. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).
2. Clone the forked repo on your machine
3. Enter the cloned folder via terminal and run:
```sh
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
1. Open it in your browser: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

Or run with [docker](https://github.com/BretFisher/jekyll-serve).
